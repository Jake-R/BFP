# BFP
BFP is a preprocessor for the esoteric programming language [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
BFP allows a user to put macros in their BF code that will be expanded by the preprocessor according to arguments.  The goal of this project is to make it easier to write BF in a large sense without stripping BF of its... *unique* qualities.
